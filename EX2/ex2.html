one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[2][3] While best known for his mass–energy 
equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"),[4] he received the 1921 Nobel 
Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the 
photoelectric effect".[5] The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<img src="albert-einstein.jpg"align=left ><p class=tito>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the 
laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special 
theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational
 fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.
 He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of 
particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the
 foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the 
large-scale structure of the universe.</p>
